The q100_bench program writes out many statistics and a large
number of bed files and plots, so this document is here just
to hold my notes on what these output files mean and how they
were generated.

BENCHMARK/RESOURCE FILES

Benchmark files are files containing information about the 
benchmark genome. Many of these files can be generated by 
running scripts in the q100_bench distribution. Their 
location on the user's file system is specified in the
config file read by the program.

If a config file is specified with the --config option and
that file exists, it will be read and the benchmark file
locations within it will be used. If the --config option
isn't passed to the program, it will look for a file named
"benchconfig.txt" in the current working directory, and use
that if it exists. Finally, if neither of these config
files are specified and exist, the benchmark configuration
file that was distributed with the program will be used,
but that doesn't have reasonable file locations at this 
time.

At this time, the two resource files read by the program are:
1. a BED formatted file with the locations in the benchmark
assembly of mononucleotide runs at least 10 bases in length.
The columns in this 9-column BED file are:
	* chromosome
	* start (0-based half open)
	* end (0-based half open)
	* name (must end with a "_" followed by the repeated
          base in upper-case)
	* score (not used)
	* strand (not used)
	* widestart (not used)
	* wideend (not used)
	* color (four-color base encoded for use in browser)
2. a BED formatted file with the locations of heterozygous
sites in the benchmark assembly. The columns in this 4-column
BED file are:
	* chromosome
	* start (0-based half open)
	* end (0-based half open)
	* het site name ("_" delimited hom. chrom and pos,
          followed by allele on entry chrom, allele on hom.
          chrom, and strand of alignment)

PROGRAM OUTPUT

Statistics:

Bed files:
1. genome.<assembly>.bed - a BED file of the entire test
genome in its own coordinates
2. nlocs.<assembly>.bed - locations of stretches of Ns of
length at least "minns" bases (default 10) in the test
genome. These are the locations where where assembly
entries (assumed to be scaffolds) will be broken into
contigs
3. atgcseq.<assembly>.bed - locations of the rest of the
test assembly sequence (i.e., regions not included in the 
nlocs.<assembly>.bed file)
4. <assembly>.benchcovered.<benchmark>.bed - regions of 
the benchmark genome covered by primary alignments of the
test assembly contained in the BAM file passed to the
program
5. testmatcovered.<assembly>.bed - regions of the test 
assembly covered by primary alignments to the maternal
chromosomes of the benchmark (similarly for the file
testpatcovered.<assembly>.bed)
6. <assembly>.variantsinaligns.<benchmark>.bed - BED-
formatted locations in the benchmark where the test 
assembly aligns but has a discrepancy.
7. <benchmark>.variantsinaligns.<assembly>.bed - BED-
formatted locations in the benchmark where the test 
assembly aligns but has a discrepancy.
